# Test Three-Flow git workflow

Found recommendations for [Three-Flow] and this repo is a test for how this would
work in practice.

This git workflow has then been picked by [Trello Android] with a slight difference that all
branch retain their history.

Three-Flow consists of three branches:

* Main
* Candidate
* Release

When merging PRs we shall use one of the following options:
 * Merge commit
 * Squash & merge
 * Rebase & merge
